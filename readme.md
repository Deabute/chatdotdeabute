# Deabute Chat

This version of deabute chat gives users the ability to navigate to channels and share channel links where chats will occur. This way interest can be divided into categories giving context for a visit.

Channels can be multi or single user. Single user channels are channels where the target abundance is trying to connect with one person and multi user channels are places where many people can be connected with anyone else visiting.
